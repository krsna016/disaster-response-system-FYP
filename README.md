# AI-powered Disaster Response System — Demo

This repository contains a small demo landing page for the "AI-powered Disaster Response System" project. It's intended as an initial static page showing the project's name and stylized initials.

Files included:

- `index.html` — Demo landing page (static).
- `styles.css` — Styles for the demo page.

How to view locally

Option 1 — Open directly

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click it). This works for a static demo but may block some features in certain browsers when opened from file://

Option 2 — Simple local server (recommended)

Using Python 3 (works on macOS):

```bash
# from the project root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps

- Replace the initials SVG with a full brand or logo.
- Add more pages (docs, roadmap, contact form).
- Integrate with a build tool or deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify.
